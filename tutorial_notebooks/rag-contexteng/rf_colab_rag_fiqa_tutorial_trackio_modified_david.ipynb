        "# Optimizing RAG Pipelines with RapidFire AI\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a practical way to make an AI assistant **answer using your documents**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Retrieve**: find the most relevant passages for a question.\n",
        "- **Generate**: give those passages to a language model so it can answer *grounded in evidence*.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this beginner-friendly Colab, we’ll build and evaluate a RAG pipeline for a **financial opinion Q&A** assistant using the [FiQA dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/explodinggradients/fiqa).\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of the kind of questions we’re targeting:\n",
        "\n",
        "- “Should I invest in index funds or individual stocks?”\n",
        "- “What’s a good way to save for retirement in my 30s?”\n",
        "- “Is it worth refinancing my mortgage right now?”\n",
        "\n",
        "## What We’re Building\n",
        "\n",
        "A concrete RAG pipeline that looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Load a financial corpus** (documents + posts).\n",
        "2. **Split documents into chunks** (so we can search smaller, more relevant pieces).\n",
        "3. **Embed the chunks** (turn text into vectors) and store them in a vector index (FAISS).\n",
        "4. **Retrieve top‑K chunks** for each question using similarity search.\n",
        "5. *(Optional)* **Rerank** the retrieved chunks with a stronger model to keep only the best evidence.\n",
        "6. **Build a prompt** that includes the question + retrieved context.\n",
        "7. **Generate an answer** with a small vLLM model.\n",
        "8. **Evaluate retrieval quality** (Precision, Recall, NDCG@5, MRR) so we can tell which settings find better evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG has a lot of “knobs”, and it’s easy to lose track of what helped. In this notebook we’ll focus on **retrieval quality** by keeping the generator (the vLLM model) fixed and only varying retrieval settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll use [RapidFireAI](https://github.com/RapidFireAI/rapidfireai) to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Define a small retrieval grid**: 2 chunking strategies × 2 reranking `top_n` values = **4 retrieval configs**.\n",
        "- **Run all configs the same way** on the same dataset.\n",
        "- **Compare retrieval metrics side-by-side** as they update (Precision/Recall/NDCG/MRR) to pick the best evidence-finding setup."
