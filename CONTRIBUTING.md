# Contributing to RapidFireAI

## Submitting a pull request (PR)

### For contributors who are in the RapidFireAI organization
* When you first create a PR, add a reviewer to the `assignee` section.
* Assignees will review your PR and add `@action-required` label if further actions are required.
* Address their comments and remove `@action-required` label from the PR.
* Repeat this process until assignees approve your PR.
* Once the PR is approved, the author is in charge of ensuring the PR passes the build.
* Committers will merge the PR once the build is passing.

### For contributors who are not in the RapidFireAI organization
* Your PRs will have assignees shortly. Assignees of PRs will be actively engaging with contributors to merge the PR.
* Please actively ping assignees after you address your comments!
